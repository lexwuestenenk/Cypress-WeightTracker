# Cypress-WeightTracker
Testing environment for WeightTracker

This is the automated test environment I've setup for WeightTracker.

To install & run cypress, please follow these steps:

- Create a new folder (either with file explorer or ```mkdir <folder-name>```

- CD (Change directory) into the newly created folder and run ```git init```, then ```git remote add origin <git-url>```
- Pull the repository using ```git pull origin master```
- After the repository has been cloned, run ```npm install cypress --save-dev``` to install cypress
- Then, run ```npm run start-cypress:test``` or ```yarn run start-cypress:test``` (Only works with config.js file available)

- You will now have a working cypress installation!
